**Marina Hirota** is an associate professor at the Department of Physics from the Federal University of Santa Catarina, where she teaches undergraduate courses in meteorology and engineering and postgraduate courses in ecology.

She has a multidisciplinary academic background with a doctorate in meteorology from the National Institute of Space Research (INPE), a master’s and a degree from the State University of Campinas (UNICAMP) in computer engineering and applied mathematics, respectively.

She is dedicated to combining mathematical and computational tools in the mechanistic understanding of the dynamics and resilience of vegetation-climate systems, especially in tropical South America, and the effects of disturbances such as climate change, fire and deforestation, resulting in potential changes in the current distribution of vegetation.
