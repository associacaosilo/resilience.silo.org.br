let yourself be lost, throw yourself into the abyss <br>
climb the mystery, the mysterious <br>
abdicate the linear path <br>
march in the direction of intuition <br>
intent <br>
through the darkness of the mist find the brightness and the glare  <br>
clarity <br>
    
pluck out wood chips, stare, hammer, strength, chisel and faith  <br>
sculpt time, light the flame with the spark of creation <br>
cross of waters, stone being, stone we are <br>
      
amplify the silence or prune with the bees? <br>
    
chords and strings, tension  <br>
flower, fruit and seed <br>
  
the kiss, the shaft <br>
the unspeakable look, subtle gesture <br>
    
undressed the possible  <br>
song of the improbable <br>
    
put the words in a pot and wait  <br>
ferment <br>
    
plant an instrument in the woods  <br>
offer(s) being <br>
playing duet with a cicada  <br>
disconcert <br>
     <br>
cure <br>
     <br>
and go back home <br>
inside... <br>
   <br>
landsman me <br>
