**Pedro Hurpia**, an artist and researcher, holds a master’s degree in Visual Arts from the State University of Campinas (UNICAMP), is a guest artist at the Temporal School of Experimental Geography (TSOEG) and also a collaborator in SEA Foundation in Tilburg (Netherlands).

His works recreates various existent devices in order to “understand” natural phenomena and geophysical anomalies that are only perceived by the human being when they emerge to the surface or when the body is directly impacted, such as landslides and sound waves. He is especially interested in questioning binary contraries which expand the analysis of his work, leaving open the certainty of what is real and fictitious.
