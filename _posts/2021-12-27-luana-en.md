**Luana Vitra** is a plastic artist graduated from Guignard School at State University of Minas Gerais (UEMG), dancer and performer. She grew up in Contagem, an industrial city that made her body experience iron and soot. Conceived between carpentry (father) and word (mother), she moves as a prayer in search of survival and healing of the landscapes she inhabits. Luana understands her own body as a trap and her action as micropolitics in dealing with the materiality and spatiality that her work evokes, confronts and confuses.
