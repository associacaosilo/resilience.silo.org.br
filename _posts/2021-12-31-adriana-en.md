**Adriana Alves** is a geologist and Ph.D. in geosciences from USP (University of São Paulo) where she also had her postdoctoral degree. She studies the Paraná-Etendeka Magmatic Province (PMP), the result of a large volcanic eruption over 134 million years ago which marks the beginning of the Atlantic’s Ocean formation at the territory known today as Brazil.

Her investigation mainly seeks to identify the gases that were released into the atmosphere during this event. Her field of action extends to the Ethics and Human Rights Commission of the Geosciences Institute at USP, which she chairs, and to the fight against racism in Science. Besides being a teacher and researcher, Adriana also shares her time being mother to little Flora and Serena.
