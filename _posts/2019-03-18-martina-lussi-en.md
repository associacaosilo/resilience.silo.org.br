SERRINHA DO ALAMBARI SOUNDWALK

The soundpiece contains fieldrecordings around Serrinha do Alambari including foot steps, breathing noises, wind noises, snatches of voices, sounds of insects, frogs, birds & electromagnetic interferences. Most of the sounds are recorded with binaural microphones whilst walking.

The composed soundpiece is experienced in a soundwalk and blends into real surround noises such as dogs, cars, voices, and other sounds of the environement. The soundwalk creates a fluidity between the inner perception of the body and the sounds that surround us.

The artist guides the group through walking in different paces and diffuses a fragrance by using scent sticks.
