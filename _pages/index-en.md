The resilience artistic residence offers immersion to artistic research and experimentations directed to artists and curators interested in developing their work in a rural environment and in Conservation Units.

On the one hand, it ́s goal is to promote a territorial experience that differs from urban life for artistic  creation and experimentation, and on the other hand, to create narratives for the present rural/environmental universe through Contemporary Art.
